Arduino Projects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
this is a collection of files I'm using for tinkering with Arduino_.
the code-examples directory came from SparkFun_

int the Circuit directory there is the original SparkFun_ Source, a Makefile,
and one or more of my own files. i'm attempting to do all the projects in
pure C with out the arduino libraries.

I've also did some digging into the Arduino Libraries to figure out how
they did some things.

Helpful links I've used
